Deliveroo has gone into voluntary administration in Australia due to poor profitability, telling customers it was difficult to make the “sad announcement” of the company’s collapse.

In a statement, Deliveroo said it was a highly competitive market in Australia with four global players.

The company determined it could not reach sustainable profits in Australia without major financial investment, and the expected return was not in line with Deliveroo’s risk/reward thresholds.

Deliveroo instead decided to stop operating in Australia, with its subsidiary placed into voluntary administration by its director.

Michael Korda, Andrew Knight and Craig Shepard of KordaMentha have been appointed voluntary administrators to wind up the company.

“Administrators had no alternative but to cease operations immediately in the absence of financial support,” Mr Korda said in a statement on Wednesday.

Deliveroo’s chief operating officer Eric French said it was a difficult decision to pull out of Australia.

“This was a difficult decision and not one we have taken lightly,” he said.

“We want to thank all our employees, consumers, riders and restaurant and grocery partners who have been involved with the Australian operations over the past seven years.

“Our focus is now on making sure our employees, riders and partners are supported throughout this process.”

Deliveroo has also written to its customers with its “sad announcement”.

“We have enjoyed serving you the amazing food that Australia is known for, working with thousands of brilliant restaurants and riders,” the email read.

“Deliveroo, like all other companies, is now doing business in challenging economic conditions, which requires us to take difficult decisions.
